details: 'Jackalope Doctrine-DBAL is an implementation of the PHP Content Repository
  API (PHPCR) using a relational database to persist data. In affected versions users
  can provoke SQL injections if they can specify a node name or query. Upgrade to
  version 1.7.4 to resolve this issue. If that is not possible, you can escape all
  places where `$property` is used to filter `sv:name` in the class `Jackalope\Transport\DoctrineDBAL\Query\QOMWalker`:
  `XPath::escape($property)`. Node names and xpaths can contain `"` or `;` according
  to the JCR specification. The jackalope component that translates the query object
  model into doctrine dbal queries does not properly escape the names and paths, so
  that a accordingly crafted node name can lead to an SQL injection. If queries are
  never done from user input, or if you validate the user input to not contain `;`,
  you are not affected.'
