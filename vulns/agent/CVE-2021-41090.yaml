details: 'Grafana Agent is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and trace
  data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack. Prior to versions 0.20.1 and
  0.21.2, inline secrets defined within a metrics instance config are exposed in plaintext
  over two endpoints: metrics instance configs defined in the base YAML file are exposed
  at `/-/config` and metrics instance configs defined for the scraping service are
  exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/:key`. Inline secrets will be exposed to anyone
  being able to reach these endpoints. If HTTPS with client authentication is not
  configured, these endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users. Secrets found
  in these sections are used for delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system,
  authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets, and authenticating
  against a system for collecting metrics. This does not apply for non-inlined secrets,
  such as `*_file` based secrets. This issue is patched in Grafana Agent versions
  0.20.1 and 0.21.2. A few workarounds are available. Users who cannot upgrade should
  use non-inline secrets where possible. Users may also desire to restrict API access
  to Grafana Agent with some combination of restricting the network interfaces Grafana
  Agent listens on through `http_listen_address` in the `server` block, configuring
  Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication, and/or using firewall rules
  to restrict external access to Grafana Agent''s API.'
