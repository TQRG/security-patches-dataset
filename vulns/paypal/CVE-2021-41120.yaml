details: 'sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development platform.
  In affected versions the URL to the payment page done after checkout was created
  with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id}) and therefore it was easy
  to predict. The problem is that the Credit card form has prefilled "credit card
  holder" field with the Customer''s first and last name and hence this can lead to
  personally identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form did
  not require authentication. The problem has been patched in Sylius/PayPalPlugin
  1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form
  route and change its URL parameters to (for example) {orderToken}/{paymentId}, then
  override the Sylius\PayPalPlugin\Controller\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to
  operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It would also
  require usage of custom repository method. Additionally, one could override the
  @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig template, to add contingencies: [''SCA_ALWAYS'']
  line in hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have to
  be handled in the function callback.'
