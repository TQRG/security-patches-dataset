details: auth0.js (NPM package auth0-js) greater than version 8.0.0 and before version
  9.12.3 has a vulnerability. In the case of an (authentication) error, the error
  object returned by the library contains the original request of the user, which
  may include the plaintext password the user entered. If the error object is exposed
  or logged without modification, the application risks password exposure. This is
  fixed in version 9.12.3
