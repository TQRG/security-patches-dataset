details: "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written\
  \ in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN,\
  \ TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE\
  \ attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation,\
  \ potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all\
  \ users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim\u2019s network\
  \ may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely\
  \ execute arbitrary code on the victim\u2019s machine. Users are advised to upgrade\
  \ as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds."
