details: 'spree_auth_devise is an open source library which provides authentication
  and authorization services for use with the Spree storefront framework by using
  an underlying Devise authentication framework. In affected versions spree_auth_devise
  is subject to a CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover. All applications
  using any version of the frontend component of spree_auth_devise are affected if
  protect_from_forgery method is both: Executed whether as: A before_action callback
  (the default). A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before the :load_object
  hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find). Configured to use :null_session
  or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy
  is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception). Users are advised
  to update their spree_auth_devise gem. For users unable to update it may be possible
  to change your strategy to :exception. Please see the linked GHSA for more workaround
  details. ### Impact CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover. All applications
  using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected
  if `protect_from_forgery` method is both: * Executed whether as: * A before_action
  callback (the default) * A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before
  the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find). * Configured
  to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default
  in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).
  That means that applications that haven''t been configured differently from what
  it''s generated with Rails aren''t affected. Thanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting
  and providing a patch ? ### Patches Spree 4.3 users should update to spree_auth_devise
  4.4.1 Spree 4.2 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.2.1 ### Workarounds If
  possible, change your strategy to :exception: ```ruby class ApplicationController
  < ActionController::Base protect_from_forgery with: :exception end ``` Add the following
  to`config/application.rb `to at least run the `:exception` strategy on the affected
  controller: ```ruby config.after_initialize do Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery
  with: :exception end ``` ### References https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise/security/advisories/GHSA-xm34-v85h-9pg2'
