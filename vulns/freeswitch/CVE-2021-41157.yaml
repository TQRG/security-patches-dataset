details: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation
  from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any
  commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated
  in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers
  to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate.
  This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar
  attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP
  extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded
  to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable
  if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update
  the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by
  default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions`
  parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced
  to explicitly disable authentication.
