details: Polr is an open source URL shortener. in Polr before version 2.3.0, a vulnerability
  in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin access to site instances, even
  if they do not possess an existing account. This vulnerability exists regardless
  of users' settings. If an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers
  to the /setup/finish endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on the
  instance. This is caused by a loose comparison (==) in SetupController that is susceptible
  to attack. The project has been patched to ensure that a strict comparison (===)
  is used to verify the setup key, and that /setup/finish verifies that no users table
  exists before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts. This is
  fixed in version 2.3.0. Users can patch this vulnerability without upgrading by
  adding abort(404) to the very first line of finishSetup in SetupController.php.
