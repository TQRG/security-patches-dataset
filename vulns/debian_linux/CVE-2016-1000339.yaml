details: In the Bouncy Castle JCE Provider version 1.55 and earlier the primary engine
  class used for AES was AESFastEngine. Due to the highly table driven approach used
  in the algorithm it turns out that if the data channel on the CPU can be monitored
  the lookup table accesses are sufficient to leak information on the AES key being
  used. There was also a leak in AESEngine although it was substantially less. AESEngine
  has been modified to remove any signs of leakage (testing carried out on Intel X86-64)
  and is now the primary AES class for the BC JCE provider from 1.56. Use of AESFastEngine
  is now only recommended where otherwise deemed appropriate.
