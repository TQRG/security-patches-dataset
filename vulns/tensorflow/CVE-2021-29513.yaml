details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Calling
  TF operations with tensors of non-numeric types when the operations expect numeric
  tensors result in null pointer dereferences. The conversion from Python array to
  C++ array(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ff70c47a396ef1e3cb73c90513da4f5cb71bebba/tensorflow/python/lib/core/ndarray_tensor.cc#L113-L169)
  is vulnerable to a type confusion. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow
  2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
