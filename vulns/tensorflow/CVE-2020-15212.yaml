details: In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment
  sum can trigger writes outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers by inserting
  negative elements in the segment ids tensor. Users having access to `segment_ids_data`
  can alter `output_index` and then write to outside of `output_data` buffer. This
  might result in a segmentation fault but it can also be used to further corrupt
  the memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create more advanced
  exploits. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would
  be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment
  ids are all positive, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are
  stored statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment
  ids are generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated
  as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround
  and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.
