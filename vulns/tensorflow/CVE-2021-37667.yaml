details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In
  affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference
  to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc#L533-L539)
  reads the first dimension of the `input_splits` tensor before validating that this
  tensor is not empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 2e0ee46f1a47675152d3d865797a18358881d7a6.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.
