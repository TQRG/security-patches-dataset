details: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The
  implementations of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` TFLite operators can be used to read
  data outside of bounds of heap allocated objects, if any of the two input tensor
  arguments are empty. This is because the broadcasting implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/maximum_minimum.h#L52-L56)
  indexes in both tensors with the same index but does not validate that the index
  is within bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
  2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
