details: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions
  the shape inference code for `QuantizeV2` can trigger a read outside of bounds of
  heap allocated array. This occurs whenever `axis` is a negative value less than
  `-1`. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer. The
  code allows `axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND`
  error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions
  of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than `-1` then this results in a heap OOB
  read. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.
