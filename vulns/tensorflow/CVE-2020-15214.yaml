details: In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment
  sum can trigger a write out bounds / segmentation fault if the segment ids are not
  sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in increasing order, using the last
  element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor.
  This results in allocating insufficient memory for the output tensor and in a write
  outside the bounds of the output array. This usually results in a segmentation fault,
  but depending on runtime conditions it can provide for a write gadget to be used
  in future memory corruption-based exploits. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would
  be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment
  ids are sorted, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored
  statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are
  generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as
  outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround
  and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.
