details: In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment
  sum can trigger a denial of service by causing an out of memory allocation in the
  implementation of segment sum. Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding
  them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very
  large value to trigger a large allocation. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a
  and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would
  be to add a custom `Verifier` to limit the maximum value in the segment ids tensor.
  This only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model,
  but a similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime,
  between inference steps. However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of
  a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users
  are advised to upgrade to patched code.
