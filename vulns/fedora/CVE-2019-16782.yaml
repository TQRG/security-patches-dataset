details: There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack
  (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers
  may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session
  id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind
  of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the
  amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a
  valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated
  randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a
  secure comparison.
