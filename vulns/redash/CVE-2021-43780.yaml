details: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0
  and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel
  is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities
  are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled.
  As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this
  by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests
  library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch.
  There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading.
  One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env
  variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One
  can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory)
  to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen.
  For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment
  variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may
  also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master`
  and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default
  value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to
  be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit
  values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.
