details: less-openui5 is an npm package which enables building OpenUI5 themes with
  Less.js. In less-openui5 before version 0.10., when processing theming resources
  (i.e. `*.less` files) with less-openui5 that originate from an untrusted source,
  those resources might contain JavaScript code which will be executed in the context
  of the build process. While this is a feature of the Less.js library it is an unexpected
  behavior in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development. Especially in the context
  of UI5 Tooling which relies on less-openui5. An attacker might create a library
  or theme-library containing a custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript
  code in one of the .less files. Refer to the referenced GHSA-3crj-w4f5-gwh4 for
  examples. Starting with Less.js version 3.0.0, the Inline JavaScript feature is
  disabled by default. less-openui5 however currently uses a fork of Less.js v1.6.3.
  Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still
  evaluates code has additional double codes around it. We decided to remove the inline
  JavaScript evaluation feature completely from the code of our Less.js fork. This
  fix is available in less-openui5 version 0.10.0.
