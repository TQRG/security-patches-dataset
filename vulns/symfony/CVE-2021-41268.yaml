details: Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP framework
  for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Since the
  rework of the Remember me cookie in version 5.3.0, the cookie is not invalidated
  when the user changes their password. Attackers can therefore maintain their access
  to the account even if the password is changed as long as they have had the chance
  to login once and get a valid remember me cookie. Starting with version 5.3.12,
  Symfony makes the password part of the signature by default. In that way, when the
  password changes, then the cookie is not valid anymore.
