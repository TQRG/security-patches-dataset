details: Matrix-appservice-bridge is the bridging service for the Matrix communication
  program's application services. In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room
  upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when
  instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters
  will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However,
  the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor`
  field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged
  room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware.
  Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic
  room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the
  `Bridge` class options.
