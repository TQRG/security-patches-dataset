details: Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior to
  version 3.33.2 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack where strings in private source
  code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects
  the Saved Searches and Code Monitoring features. A successful attack would require
  an authenticated bad actor to create many Saved Searches or Code Monitors to receive
  confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess
  formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in version
  3.33.2 and any future versions of Sourcegraph. We strongly encourage upgrading to
  secure versions. If you are unable to, you may disable Saved Searches and Code Monitors.
