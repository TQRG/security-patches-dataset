details: Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application
  written in PHP. In Time Tracker before version 1.19.27.5431 a Cross site request
  forgery (CSRF) vulnerability existed. The nature of CSRF is that a logged on user
  may be tricked by social engineering to click on an attacker-provided form that
  executes an unintended action such as changing user password. The vulnerability
  is fixed in Time Tracker version 1.19.27.5431. Upgrade is recommended. If upgrade
  is not practical, introduce ttMitigateCSRF() function in /WEB-INF/lib/common.php.lib
  using the latest available code and call it from ttAccessAllowed().
