details: WarnSystem is a cog (plugin) for the Red discord bot. A vulnerability has
  been found in the code that allows any user to access sensible informations by setting
  up a specific template which is not properly sanitized. The problem has been patched
  in version 1.3.18. Users should update and type `!warnsysteminfo` to check that
  their version is 1.3.18 or above. As a workaround users may unload the WarnSystem
