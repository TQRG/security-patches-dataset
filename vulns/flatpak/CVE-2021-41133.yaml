details: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop
  applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with
  direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse
  can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though
  it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating
  the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist
  seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file
  disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as
  those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that
  the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols
  that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility
  bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`,
  whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these
  buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of publication,
  a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There are no workarounds aside from
  upgrading to a patched version.
