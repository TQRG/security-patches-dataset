details: Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop
  applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that
  can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a
  sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and
  before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`,
  also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps
  in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance,
  either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security
  settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium
  to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses
  a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the
  Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed
  processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that
  is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app
  could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and
  use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this
  vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting,
  but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This
  is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.
