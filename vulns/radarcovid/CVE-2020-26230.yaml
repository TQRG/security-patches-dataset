details: Radar COVID is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for Spain.
  In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19
  positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server is possible.
  This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive
  users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar
  COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made
  by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor
  traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test.
  Such an adversary can be the mobile network operator (MNO) if the connection is
  done through a mobile network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the connection
  is done through the Internet (e.g., a home network), a VPN provider used by the
  user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise networks, or any eavesdropper
  with access to the same network (WiFi or Ethernet) as the user as could be the case
  of public WiFi hotspots deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee
  shops. The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to
  succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable
  information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection
  to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic
  to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies
  or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without
  encryption). The former can be executed, for instance, by the Internet Service Provider
  or the MNO. The latter can be executed by any on-path adversary, such as the network
  provider or even the cloud provider that hosts more than one service accessed by
  the victim. The farther the adversary is either from the victim (the client) or
  the end-point (the server), the less likely it may be that the adversary has access
  to re-identification information. The vulnerability has been mitigated with the
  injection of dummy traffic from the application to the backend. Dummy traffic is
  generated by all users independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not.
  The issue was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential
  distribution), Android in version 1.0.7 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential
  distribution), Backend in version 1.1.2-RELEASE. For more information see the referenced
  GitHub Security Advisory.
