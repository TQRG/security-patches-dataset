details: 'discourse-footnote is a library providing footnotes for posts in Discourse.
  ### Impact When posting an inline footnote wrapped in `<a>` tags (e.g. `<a>^[footnote]</a>`,
  the resulting rendered HTML would include a nested `<a>`, which is stripped by Nokogiri
  because it is not valid. This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because
  we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting
  its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript.
  Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts
  from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the
  plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.'
