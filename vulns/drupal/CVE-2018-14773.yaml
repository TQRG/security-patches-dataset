details: An issue was discovered in Http Foundation in Symfony 2.7.0 through 2.7.48,
  2.8.0 through 2.8.43, 3.3.0 through 3.3.17, 3.4.0 through 3.4.13, 4.0.0 through
  4.0.13, and 4.1.0 through 4.1.2. It arises from support for a (legacy) IIS header
  that lets users override the path in the request URL via the X-Original-URL or X-Rewrite-URL
  HTTP request header. These headers are designed for IIS support, but it's not verified
  that the server is in fact running IIS, which means anybody who can send these requests
  to an application can trigger this. This affects \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request::prepareRequestUri()
  where X-Original-URL and X_REWRITE_URL are both used. The fix drops support for
  these methods so that they cannot be used as attack vectors such as web cache poisoning.
