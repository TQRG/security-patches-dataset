details: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing
  in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with no filter, which is an
  N=0 case when it expected at least one line to have been read, thus making the N-1
  index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds
  write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and
  mmap system calls.
