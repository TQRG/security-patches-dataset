details: DHIS 2 is an information system for data capture, management, validation,
  analytics and visualization. A SQL Injection vulnerability in the Tracker component
  in DHIS2 Server allows authenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands
  via unspecified vectors. This vulnerability affects the `/api/trackedEntityInstances`
  and `/api/trackedEntityInstances/query` API endpoints in all DHIS2 versions 2.34,
  2.35, and 2.36. It also affects versions 2.32 and 2.33 which have reached _end of
  support_ - exceptional security updates have been added to the latest *end of support*
  builds for these versions. Versions 2.31 and older are unaffected. The system is
  vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no
  known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2
  user. The vulnerability is not exposed to a non-malicious user - the vulnerability
  requires a conscious attack to be exploited. A successful exploit of this vulnerability
  could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance.
  There are no known exploits of the security vulnerabilities addressed by these patch
  releases. Security patches are available in DHIS2 versions 2.32-EOS, 2.33-EOS, 2.34.7,
  2.35.7, and 2.36.4. There is no straightforward known workaround for DHIS2 instances
  using the Tracker functionality other than upgrading the affected DHIS2 server to
  one of the patches in which this vulnerability has been fixed. For implementations
  which do NOT use Tracker functionality, it may be possible to block all network
  access to POST to the `/api/trackedEntityInstances`, and `/api/trackedEntityInstances/query`
  endpoints as a temporary workaround while waiting to upgrade.
