details: OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem
  before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to
  dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting
  system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash
  value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords.
  This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated
  salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in
  the voting system.
