details: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License
  v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side
  request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for
  importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from
  a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality
  by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path
  traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can
  abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker
  can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit
  data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server
  configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled
  databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended
  to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users
  are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with
  "MINIO_BROWSER=off" environment variable.
