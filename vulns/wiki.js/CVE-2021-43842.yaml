details: Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier
  are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating
  a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting
  attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is
  viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page
  via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this
  vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to
  all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload
  for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version
  to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a
  patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258.
