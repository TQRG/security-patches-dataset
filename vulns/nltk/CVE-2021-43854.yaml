details: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules,
  data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language
  Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial
  of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer,
  sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions,
  are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input
  to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount
  of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for
  tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading
  to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the
  execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any
  of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.
