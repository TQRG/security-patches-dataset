details: cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and simple interface
  for accessing fingerprint APIs on both Android 6+ and iOS. In versions prior to
  5.0.1 The exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity`
  can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't
  handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in
  a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission.
  A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from
  working and make the victim unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio
  doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If you want to
  fix older versions change the attribute android:exported in plugin.xml to false.
  Please upgrade to version 5.0.1 as soon as possible.
