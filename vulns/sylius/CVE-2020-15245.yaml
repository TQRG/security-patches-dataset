details: In Sylius before versions 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3, the user may register in
  a shop by email mail@example.com, verify it, change it to the mail another@domain.com
  and stay verified and enabled. This may lead to having accounts addressed to totally
  different emails, that were verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take
  over any existing account (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in Sylius
  1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3. As a workaround, you may resolve this issue on your own
  by creating a custom event listener, which will listen to the sylius.customer.pre_update
  event. You can determine that email has been changed if customer email and user
  username are different. They are synchronized later on. Pay attention, to email
  changing behavior for administrators. You may need to skip this logic for them.
  In order to achieve this, you should either check master request path info, if it
  does not contain /admin prefix or adjust event triggered during customer update
  in the shop. You can find more information on how to customize the event here.
