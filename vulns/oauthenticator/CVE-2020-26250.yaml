details: 'OAuthenticator is an OAuth login mechanism for JupyterHub. In oauthenticator
  from version 0.12.0 and before 0.12.2, the deprecated (in jupyterhub 1.2) configuration
  `Authenticator.whitelist`, which should be transparently mapped to `Authenticator.allowed_users`
  with a warning, is instead ignored by OAuthenticator classes, resulting in the same
  behavior as if this configuration has not been set. If this is the only mechanism
  of authorization restriction (i.e. no group or team restrictions in configuration)
  then all authenticated users will be allowed. Provider-based restrictions, including
  deprecated values such as `GitHubOAuthenticator.org_whitelist` are **not** affected.
  All users of OAuthenticator 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 with JupyterHub 1.2 (JupyterHub Helm
  chart 0.10.0-0.10.5) who use the `admin.whitelist.users` configuration in the jupyterhub
  helm chart or the `c.Authenticator.whitelist` configuration directly. Users of other
  deprecated configuration, e.g. `c.GitHubOAuthenticator.team_whitelist` are **not**
  affected. If you see a log line like this and expect a specific list of allowed
  usernames: "[I 2020-11-27 16:51:54.528 JupyterHub app:1717] Not using allowed_users.
  Any authenticated user will be allowed." you are likely affected. Updating oauthenticator
  to 0.12.2 is recommended. A workaround is to replace the deprecated `c.Authenticator.whitelist
  = ...` with `c.Authenticator.allowed_users = ...`. If any users have been authorized
  during this time who should not have been, they must be deleted via the API or admin
  interface, per the referenced documentation.'
