details: "containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as\
  \ a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3,\
  \ the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access\
  \ controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had\
  \ an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix\
  \ domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network\
  \ namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges,\
  \ to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability\
  \ has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions\
  \ as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with\
  \ an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running\
  \ containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not\
  \ providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network\
  \ namespace as the shim (typically the \"host\" network namespace, for example with\
  \ docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an\
  \ effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers\
  \ with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with\
  \ AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is\
  \ best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero\
  \ UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise\
  \ against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms\
  \ used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless\
  \ of what container runtime is used for running that container."
