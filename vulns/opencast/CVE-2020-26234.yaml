details: Opencast before versions 8.9 and 7.9 disables HTTPS hostname verification
  of its HTTP client used for a large portion of Opencast's HTTP requests. Hostname
  verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented
  certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle
  attacks. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast 8.8 Please be aware
  that fixing the problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any self-signed
  certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need those, please
  make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better yet, get a valid certificate.
