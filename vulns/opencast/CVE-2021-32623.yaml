details: Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture and
  distribution. Versions of Opencast prior to 9.6 are vulnerable to the billion laughs
  attack, which allows an attacker to easily execute a (seemingly permanent) denial
  of service attack, essentially taking down Opencast using a single HTTP request.
  To exploit this, users need to have ingest privileges, limiting the group of potential
  attackers The problem has been fixed in Opencast 9.6. There is no known workaround
  for this issue.
