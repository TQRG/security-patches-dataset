details: Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for Education.
  Opencast versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing, allowing to change the
  assumed HTTP method via URL parameter. This allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests
  into PUT requests or an HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions
  otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery
  (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible. The vulnerability allows
  attackers to craft links or forms which may change the server state. This issue
  is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.0. You can mitigate the problem by setting the
  `SameSite=Strict` attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for you
  depends on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.
