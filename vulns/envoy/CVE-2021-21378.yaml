details: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy
  version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with
  an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter
  is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a
  mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with
  the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed
  error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation,
  a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any`
  was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker
  can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in
  the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT
  token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced
  on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny
  in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers'
  results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer
  was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation
  was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token
  with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The
  fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental
  conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass
  occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable
  component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there
  is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.
