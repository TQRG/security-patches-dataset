details: In Pannellum from 2.5.0 through 2.5.4 URLs were not sanitized for data URIs
  (or vbscript:), allowing for potential XSS attacks. Such an attack would require
  a user to click on a hot spot to execute and would require an attacker-provided
  configuration. The most plausible potential attack would be if pannellum.htm was
  hosted on a domain that shared cookies with the targeted site's user authentication;
  an &lt;iframe&gt; could then be embedded on the attacker's site using pannellum.htm
  from the targeted site, which would allow the attacker to potentially access information
  from the targeted site as the authenticated user (or worse if the targeted site
  did not have adequate CSRF protections) if the user clicked on a hot spot in the
  attacker's embedded panorama viewer. This was patched in version 2.5.5.
