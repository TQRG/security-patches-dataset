details: URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js
  before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character
  followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions,
  the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts
  may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired
  behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com`
  will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched
  versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior
  of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers
  and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload
  variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload
  variant.]
