details: 'Snudown is a reddit-specific fork of the Sundown Markdown parser used by
  GitHub, with Python integration added. In affected versions snudown was found to
  be vulnerable to denial of service attacks to its reference table implementation.
  References written in markdown ` [reference_name]: https://www.example.com` are
  inserted into a hash table which was found to have a weak hash function, meaning
  that an attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it. This
  makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack, a type of algorithmic
  complexity attack. Further the hash table allowed for duplicate entries resulting
  in long retrieval times. Proofs of concept and further discussion of the hash collision
  issue are discussed on the snudown GHSA(https://github.com/reddit/snudown/security/advisories/GHSA-6gvv-9q92-w5f6).
  Users are advised to update to version 1.7.0.'
