details: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to
  OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module.
  In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a "zip-slip" vulnerability.
  The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically
  extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links
  and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers
  linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of
  the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user
  who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras`
  CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.
  The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds
  other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the
  workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use
  other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.
